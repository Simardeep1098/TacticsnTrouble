This is the repository for Assignment 2 work for ITECH2309.

This folder contains an Eclipse project configured for Java. 
All that you and your partner will need to do is create a code files in the 'src' folder (in the subfolder named 'itech2309a2' or other subfolders for any other package you create), and then create Java classes within that.

If you use the Eclipse IDE (which is recommended by the teaching staff), then you should be able to easily import this repository into Eclipse as a "Project from Git", which will clone this repository to your computers. Instructions to remind you how, can be found in the document titled "Using Eclipse IDE to interface with GitHub repository" on Moodle found in the "Course Information" section - Follow the instructions from page 11 onwards, which is titled "Cloning a repository that is hosted on GitHub, into your Eclipse IDE – by using the import Wizard". You should only need to clone the repository once on your computer.

Make sure you both make regular commits as you complete portions of the assignment.

If you encounter problems when trying to commit, it may be that your partner has committed other work into the repository, requiring you to first fetch those
changes and merge them into your copy of the repository - if there is a conflict to resolve, you need to then to do a "merge commit" before you can proceed any further.
